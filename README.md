This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML that can occur when using JavaScript to manipulate the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element.  Specifically, this bug arises when attempting to assign a JavaScript object directly to `innerHTML`. The `innerHTML` property expects a string, not an object. Attempting to do this will result in the object being interpreted literally as an object and not as HTML.
